Dr. Jianshi Jin (nick name: Frank) is currently a research scientist at RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research (BDR), located in Osaka, Japan. His current research focuses on developing new single-cell-based techniques in order to understand biological systems or diseases. 

Dr. Jin received his B.S. degree from the School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Nanjing University (China) under the supervision of prof. Jing-Lin Zuo in 2009. He then joined the Biomedical Pioneering Innovation Center (BIOPIC) at Peking University (China), where he obtained his Ph.D. under the supervision of Profs. Xiao-Dong Su, X. Sunney Xie, and Yujie Sun (Prof Xie’s co-PI at the time) in 2014. He was a visiting scholar at Harvard University in 2010-2011. During his PhD studies, he was awarded multiple honors including the National Scholarship of China and the Excellent Doctor Degree Disseration of Peking University for his thesis on the fine-tuning regulation of the DNA structure in DNA-protein interactions. He continued his postdoctoral training at Peking University as a “Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences” Postdoctoral fellow until 2016, focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation by non-CpG methylated DNA. In 2016, he joined Dr. Katsuyuki Shiroguchi Team at RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research (BDR) in Japan, where he received a Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Postdoctoral Fellowship in 2017. In 2019, he was promoted to research scientist in the same lab.
